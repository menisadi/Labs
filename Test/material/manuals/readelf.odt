DESCRIPTION


       readelf displays information about one or more ELF format object files.
       The options control what particular information to display.

       elffile...  are the object files to be examined.	 32-bit and 64-bit ELF
       files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.

       This program performs a similar function to objdump but	it  goes  into
       more detail and it exists independently of the BFD library, so if there
       is a bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.

OPTIONS


       The long and short forms of options, shown here	as  alternatives,  are
       equivalent.  At least one option besides -v or -H must be given.

       -a
       --all
	   Equivalent  to  specifying --file-header, --program-headers, --sec-
	   tions, --symbols, --relocs, --dynamic, --notes and  --version-info.

       -h
       --file-header
	   Displays  the  information contained in the ELF header at the start
	   of the file.

       -l
       --program-headers
       --segments
	   Displays the information contained in the file's  segment  headers,
	   if it has any.

       -S
       --sections
       --section-headers
	   Displays  the  information contained in the file's section headers,
	   if it has any.

       -g
       --section-groups
	   Displays the information contained in the file's section groups, if
	   it has any.

       -t
       --section-details
	   Displays the detailed section information. Implies -S.

       -s
       --symbols
       --syms
	   Displays the entries in symbol table section of the file, if it has
	   one.

       -e
       --headers
	   Display all the headers in the file.	 Equivalent to -h -l -S.

       -n
       --notes
	   Displays the contents of the NOTE segments and/or sections, if any.

       -r
       --relocs
	   Displays  the  contents of the file's relocation section, if it has
	   one.

       -u
       --unwind
	   Displays the contents of the file's unwind section, if it has  one.
	   Only	 the  unwind  sections	for  IA64 ELF files are currently sup-
	   ported.

       -d
       --dynamic
	   Displays the contents of the file's dynamic section, if it has one.

       -V
       --version-info
	   Displays  the contents of the version sections in the file, it they
	   exist.

       -A
       --arch-specific
	   Displays architecture-specific information in the file, if there is
	   any.

       -D
       --use-dynamic
	   When	 displaying  symbols, this option makes readelf use the symbol
	   table in the file's dynamic section, rather than  the  one  in  the
	   symbols section.

       -x <number or name>
       --hex-dump=<number or name>
	   Displays  the  contents  of	the indicated section as a hexadecimal
	   dump.  A number identifies a particular section  by	index  in  the
	   section  table;  any other string identifies all sections with that
	   name in the object file.

       -w[liaprmfFsoR]
       --debug-dump[=line,=info,=abbrev,=pub-
       names,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=frames-interp,=str,=loc,=Ranges]
	   Displays the contents of the debug sections in the file, if any are
	   present.   If  one  of  the	optional  letters or words follows the
	   switch then only data found in  those  specific  sections  will  be
	   dumped.

       -I
       --histogram
	   Display a histogram of bucket list lengths when displaying the con-
	   tents of the symbol tables.

       -v
       --version
	   Display the version number of readelf.

       -W
       --wide
	   Don't break output lines to fit into 80 columns. By default readelf
	   breaks  section  header  and	 segment  listing lines for 64-bit ELF
	   files, so that they fit into 80 columns. This option causes readelf
	   to  print each section header resp. each segment one a single line,
	   which is far more readable on terminals wider than 80 columns.

       -H
       --help
	   Display the command line options understood by readelf.

       @file
	   Read command-line options from file.	 The options read are inserted
	   in  place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
	   cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and  not
	   removed.

	   Options  in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace charac-
	   ter may be included in an option by surrounding the	entire	option
	   in  either  single  or  double  quotes.  Any character (including a
	   backslash) may  be  included	 by  prefixing	the  character	to  be
	   included  with a backslash.	The file may itself contain additional
	   @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
