GETC(3) 	       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual 	       GETC(3)

NAME


     fgetc, getc, getchar, getw -- get next character or word from input
     stream

LIBRARY


     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS


     #include <stdio.h>

     int
     fgetc(FILE *stream);

     int
     getc(FILE *stream);

     int
     getchar();

     int
     getw(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION


     The fgetc() function obtains the next input character (if present) from
     the stream pointed at by stream, or the next character pushed back on the
     stream via ungetc(3).

     The getc() function acts essentially identically to fgetc(), but is a
     macro that expands in-line.

     The getchar() function is equivalent to getc(stdin).

     The getw() function obtains the next int (if present) from the stream
     pointed at by stream.

RETURN VALUES


     If successful, these routines return the next requested object from the
     stream.  Character values are returned as an unsigned char converted to
     an int.  If the stream is at end-of-file or a read error occurs, the rou-
     tines return EOF.	The routines feof(3) and ferror(3) must be used to
     distinguish between end-of-file and error.  If an error occurs, the
     global variable errno is set to indicate the error.  The end-of-file con-
     dition is remembered, even on a terminal, and all subsequent attempts to
     read will return EOF until the condition is cleared with clearerr(3).

SEE ALSO


     ferror(3), fopen(3), fread(3), putc(3), ungetc(3)

STANDARDS


     The fgetc(), getc() and getchar() functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1990
     (``ISO C89'').

BUGS


     Since EOF is a valid integer value, feof(3) and ferror(3) must be used to
     check for failure after calling getw().  The size and byte order of an
     int varies from one machine to another, and getw() is not recommended for
     portable applications.
