System Calls                                               dup(2)

NAME


     dup - duplicate an open file descriptor

SYNOPSIS


     #include <unistd.h>

     int dup(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION


     The dup() function returns a new file descriptor having  the
     following  in  common with the original open file descriptor
     fildes:

       o  same open file (or pipe)

       o  same file pointer (that is, both file descriptors share
          one file pointer)

       o  same access mode (read, write or read/write).

     The new file descriptor is set to remain  open  across  exec
     functions (see fcntl(2)).

     The file descriptor returned is the lowest one available.

     The dup(fildes) function call is equivalent to:

          fcntl(fildes, F_DUPFD, 0)

RETURN VALUES


     Upon   successful   completion,   a   non-negative   integer
     representing  the file descriptor is returned. Otherwise, -1
     is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS


     The dup() function will fail if:

     EBADF           The fildes argument is not a valid open file
                     descriptor.

     EINTR           A signal was caught during the execution  of
                     the dup() function.

     EMFILE          The process has too  many  open  files  (see
                     getrlimit(2)).

     ENOLINK         The fildes argument is on a  remote  machine
                     and  the  link  to that machine is no longer
                     active.
