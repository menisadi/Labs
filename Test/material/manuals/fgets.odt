NAME


     gets, fgets - get a string from a stream

SYNOPSIS


     #include <stdio.h>

     char *gets(char *s);

     char *fgets(char *s, int n, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION


     The gets() function reads  bytes  from  the  standard  input
     stream  (see  intro(3)), stdin, into the array pointed to by
     s, until a newline character is read or an end-of-file  con-
     dition  is  encountered.  The newline character is discarded
     and the string is terminated with a null byte.

     If the length of an  input  line  exceeds  the  size  of  s,
     indeterminate  behavior  may  result. For this reason, it is
     strongly recommended that gets()  be  avoided  in  favor  of
     fgets().

     The fgets() function reads bytes from the  stream  into  the
     array  pointed  to by s, until n-1 bytes are read, or a new-
     line character is read and transferred to s, or  an  end-of-
     file condition is encountered. The string is then terminated
     with a null byte.

     The fgets() and gets() functions may mark the st_atime field
     of  the file associated with stream for update. The st_atime
     field will be marked for update by the first successful exe-
     cution   of   fgetc(3C),   fgets(),  fread(3C),  fscanf(3C),
     getc(3C), getchar(3C), gets(),  or  scanf(3C)  using  stream
     that returns data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc(3C)
     or ungetwc(3C).

RETURN VALUES


     If end-of-file is encountered and no bytes have  been  read,
     no  bytes  are  transferred  to  s  and  a  null  pointer is
     returned. For standard-conforming (see standards(5))  appli-
     cations, if the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set,
     no bytes are transferred to s and a null pointer is returned
     whether or not the stream is at end-of-file. If a read error
     occurs, such as trying to use these functions on a file that
     has  not been opened for reading, a null pointer is returned
     and the error indicator for the stream is  set.  If  end-of-
     file  is  encountered,  the  EOF indicator for the stream is
     set.  Otherwise s is returned.

ERRORS


     Refer to fgetc(3C).
